### Hi there 👋

I'm YK, an undergraduate majoring Computer Science 🖥️ and minoring Industrial Design 🖌️ at KAIST. My current focus lies at the intersection of Human-AI Interaction (HAI) and education. Dedicated to addressing opportunity gaps, my goal is to empower learners, ensuring they don't miss out on valuable learning experiences. With a keen interest in optimizing student personalization, my research aims to ultimately enhance confidence levels in learning. I aspire to foster an environment where every student feels supported, eliminating discouragement and promoting inclusivity.
